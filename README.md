# Perso_snake_AI
A genetic algorithm to play a game of Snake !

## test : 
The test program isn't very important, it's where programs are tested 
to make sure they do what we want them to do. I always delete everything to test 
the next program.


## Snake_Game : 
In this program, you have a couple first variables initialized : 
colors, snake initial position, size and direction. 
Then you have a couple a functions, one to spawn fruits so they 
don't appear ON the snake, one to tell the program what do 
when the player loses...  
Then, there is a huge loop to run the game, which ends when the player loses.

## AI_plays_Snake : 
In this program, the AI is controlling the Snake.
