# Perso_snake_AI
A genetic algorithm to play a game of Snake !

## Sandbox :
The Sandbox program isn't very important, it's where programs are tested 
to make sure they do what we want them to do. I always delete everything to test 
the next program.

## Snake_Game : 
In this program, you have a couple first variables initialized : 
colors, snake initial position, size and direction. 
Then you have a couple a functions, one to spawn fruits so they 
don't appear ON the snake, one to tell the program what to do 
when the player loses...  
At first there was a huge loop to run the game, but I put it into a function.

## Neural Network :
In OOP, we create the basic elements of a neural network, the neuron, the layers and the network. It ends up being very
similar to the keras library. I implemented linear combination, activation functions and forward propagation. 

## AI_plays_Snake : 
In this program, the AI is controlling the Snake. Right now, the AI
has random weights. The input vector is the distance to the snake's head to each of the walls, 
to its own body on the top and bottom, and to the fruit. We can say that it only looks in 4 directions for three 
different things. 
Also, running the game is supposed to return the score, it doesn't do that yet. I think the score is going to be the only thing we look at 
when we want to evaluate the AI.

## Training_Functions:
Training functions is where the magic happens and we code all the functions related to genetic algorithms architecture. 
## Test
The test program is here to see that the other programs work well. It's in my branch yay.
